# Guidelines for contributing to Zipkin.

Please create a pull request against `master`.

Try to make the code in the pull request as focused and clean as possible.  See
our [style guide](http://twitter.github.com/effectivescala/).  If the pull 
request is too large, we may ask you to split it into smaller ones.

## Tags
Git tags are only used for releases and take the form N.N.N(-rcN). OpenZipkin
contributors must not make other tags, as it will cause accidental commits to
master.
