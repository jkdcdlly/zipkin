This doc describes a quickstart to running zipkin with
cassandra, which is the configuration most commonly used.  All of
these services are running on one machine in the setup described here.
It presumes you have a clean-ish Ubuntu 12.04 install, and a user with
sudo capabilities (eg user is in wheel group and wheel group is
allowed in /etc/sudoers)

This includes building Zipkin from the current master branch from Github.
