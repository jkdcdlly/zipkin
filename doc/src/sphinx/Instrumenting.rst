Instrumenting a library
=======================

Finagle
-------

Running a Finagle service makes it very easy to trace with Zipkin. If your
service uses the DefaultTracer simply make your service depend on
finagle-zipkin. That will inject the ZipkinTracer into the DefaultTracer and
provide flags to set the host:port that it should send scribe messages to.

For current APIs the DefaultTracer is already used:

::

  Protocol.serve(...)
  Protocol.newClient(...)

When using the builders, however, the tracer parameter will need to be set:

::

  ServerBuilder()
    .tracer(DefaultTracer)
    ...
    .build()

  ClientBuilder()
    .tracer(DefaultTracer)
    ...
    .build()

Additional annotations can be recorded via the Trace object:

::

  Trace.record("time stamped annotation")
  Trace.recordBinary("annotation key", some value of nearly any type)


Instrumenting Other Libraries
-----------------------------

Let's walk through the parts required to instrument a service that doens't
already have support for Zipkin.

Core data structures
--------------------

First, there are a core set of structures that we need:

**Annotation**

An Annotation is used to record an occurance in time. There's a set of core
annotations used to define the beginning and end of a request:

* **cs** - Client Start. The client has made the request. This sets the
  beginning of the span.
* **sr** - Server Receive. The server has received the request and will start
  processing it. The difference between this and `cs` will be combination of
  network latency and clock jitter.
* **ss** - Server Send. The server has completed processing and has sent the
  request back to the client. The difference between this and `ss` will be the
  amount of time it took the server to process the request.
* **cr** - Client Recieve. The client has received the response from the server.
  This sets the end of the span. The RPC is considered complete when this
  annotation is recorded.

Other annotations can be recorded during the request's lifetime in order to
provide further insight. For instance adding an annotation when a server begins
and ends an expensive computation may provide insight into how much time is
being spent pre and post processing the request versus how much time is spent
running the calculation.

**BinaryAnnotation**

Binary annotations do not have a time component. They are meant to provide extra
information about the RPC. For instance, when calling an HTTP service providing
the URI of the call will help with later analysis of requests coming into the
service.

**Span**

A set of Annotations and BinaryAnnotations that correspond to a particular RPC.
Spans contain identifying information such as traceId, spandId, parentId, and
RPC name.

**Trace**

A set of spans that share a single root span. Traces are built by collecting all
Spans that share a traceId. The spans are then arranged in a tree based on
spanId and parentId thus providing an overview of the path a request takes
through the system.

Trace identifiers
-----------------

In order to reassmble a set of spans into a full trace three pieces of
information are required. These are all 64 bits long.

**Trace Id**

The overall ID of the trace. Every span in a trace will share this ID.

**Span Id**

The ID for a particular span. This may or may not be the same as the
trace id.

**Parent Id**

This is an optional ID that will only be present on child spans. That is the
span without a parent id is considered the root of the trace.

Generating identifiers
----------------------

Let's walk through how Spans are identified.

For the initial receipt of a request no trace information exists. So we create a
trace id and span id. These should be 64 random bits. The span id can be the same
as the trace id.

If the request already has trace information attached to it, the service should
use that information as server receive and server send events are part of the
same span as the client send and client receive events

If the service calls out to a downstream service a new span is created as a
child of the former span. It is identified by the same trace id, a new span id,
and the parent id is set to the span id of the previous span. The new span id
should be 64 random bits.

**Note** This process must be repeated if the service makes multiple downstream
calls. That is each subsequent span will have the same trace id and parent id,
but a new and different span id.

Communicating trace information
-------------------------------

Trace information needs to be passed between upstream and downstream services in
order to reassemble a complete trace. Five pieces of information are required:

* Trace Id
* Span Id
* Parent Id
* Is Sampled
* Flags

"Is Sampled" lets the downstream service know if it should record trace
information for the request.

"Flags" provide the ability to create and communicate feature flags. This is how
we can tell downstream services that this is a "debug" request.

Finagle provides mechanisms for passing this information with Http and Thrift
requests. Other protocols will need to be augmented with the information for
tracing to be effective.

**Http Tracing**

Http headers are used to pass along trace information:

The B3 portion of the header is so named for the original name of Zipkin:
BigBrotherBird.

Ids are encoded as `hex strings`_

* X-B3-TraceId: 64 encoded bits
* X-B3-SpanId: 64 encoded bits
* X-B3-ParentSpanId: 64 encoded bits
* X-B3-Sampled: Boolean (either "1" or "0")
* X-B3-Flags: a Long

.. _hex strings: https://github.com/twitter/finagle/blob/master/finagle-core/src/main/scala/com/twitter/finagle/tracing/Id.scala

**Thrift Tracing**

Finagle clients and servers negotate whether they can handle extra information
in the header of the thrift message when a connection is established. Once
negotiated trace data is packed into the front of each thrift message.
