[Zipkin](http://twitter.github.com/zipkin) is a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures. The front end is a "waterfall" style graph of service calls showing call durations as horizontal bars:

## Running Zipkin

Zipkin minimally needs a datastore, query and UI server. Some architectures also include
a collection tier (ex polling Kafka).

![Architecture](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/raw/master/doc/architecture-0.png)

If you are familiar with Docker, the
quickest way to get started quickly is to use the
[Docker Zipkin](https://github.com/openzipkin/docker-zipkin) project,
which (in addition to being able to build docker images) provides
scripts and a
[`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/openzipkin/docker-zipkin/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)
for launching pre-built images, e.g.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/openzipkin/docker-zipkin
$ cd docker-zipkin
$ docker-compose up
```

If you are happy building from source you can use the scripts in the
[`bin`](bin) directory of this repository.

Here's how to start zipkin using the default file-based backend and view traces.
```bash
# get the zipkin source and change to its directory
$ git clone https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin; cd zipkin
# start the query server in a new terminal session or tab
$ ./bin/query
# start the web server in a new terminal session or tab
$ ./bin/web
# create dummy traces
$ ./bin/tracegen
# open the ui and look at them!
$ open http://localhost:8080/
```
