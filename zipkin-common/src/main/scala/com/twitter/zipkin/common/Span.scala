/**
 * A trace is a series of spans (often RPC calls) which form a latency tree.
 *
 * <p/>Spans are usually created by instrumentation in RPC clients or servers, but can also
 * represent in-process activity. Annotations in spans are similar to log statements, and are
 * sometimes created directly by application developers to indicate events of interest, such as a
 * cache miss.
 *
 * <p/>The root span is where [[parentId]] is empty; it usually has the longest [[duration]] in the
 * trace.
 *
 * <p/>Span identifiers are packed into longs, but should be treated opaquely. String encoding is
 * fixed-width lower-hex, to avoid signed interpretation.
 *
 * @param traceId unique 8-byte identifier for a trace, set on all spans within it.
 * @param name span name in lowercase, rpc method for example. Conventionally, when the span name
 *             isn't known, name = "unknown".
 * @param id unique 8-byte identifier of this span within a trace. A span is uniquely
 *           identified in storage by (trace_id, id).
 * @param parentId the parent's [[id]]; absent if this the root span in a trace.
 * @param timestamp epoch microseconds of the start of this span; absent if this an incomplete span.
 * @param duration measurement in microseconds of the critical path, if known.
 * @param annotations associates events that explain latency with a timestamp. Unlike log
 *                    statements, annotations are often codes: for example [[Constants.ServerRecv]].
 *                    Annotations are sorted ascending by timestamp.
 * @param binaryAnnotations tags a span with context, usually to support query or aggregation. For
 *                          example, a binary annotation key could be "http.uri".
 * @param debug true is a request to store this span even if it overrides sampling policy.
